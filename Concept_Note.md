# Gamify – Concept Note
## Overview

Gamify is a community engagement platform built on a hierarchical role system (inspired by Discord). The platform motivates participation through events, tasks, and a point-based reward system, encouraging members to stay active and contribute.

## Hierarchy

### Organisation

 - Top-level entity.

 - Has the points system and everything else, Currently only one but plan to add more in the future...

### Admins

 - Create events.

 - Manage platform operations and the shop.

### Event Staff

 - Design tasks within events.

 - Manage point distribution balance.

### Moderators

 - Validate and approve completed tasks.

 - Award points to members.

### Members

 - Participate in events and tasks.

 - Earn points through engagement.

## Core Mechanics

Events → Organised by admins; main units of engagement.

Tasks → Specific objectives inside events; completion earns points.

Points → Currency members earn for completing tasks or as rewards from admins.

Shop → Virtual marketplace managed by admins where members can spend points.

Leaderboard → Displays rankings to encourage healthy competition.

## Rules & Restrictions

 - Members cannot transfer/share points between themselves (prevents abuse).

 - Points are only earned through task completion or admin rewards.

## Vision
